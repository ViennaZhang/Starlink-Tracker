# Starlink: React JS based Starlink Trajectory Visualization

## Description

In this project, I designed and developed a visualization dashboard using ReactJS and D3 to track satellites in real-time based on geo-location. I built location, altitude, and duration based selector to refine satellite search, and animated selected satellite paths on a world map using D3 to improve the user friendliness.

Used the [N2YO Rest API](https://www.n2yo.com/api) as the data source of the application.
